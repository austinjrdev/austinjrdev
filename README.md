# Introduction 

AustinJrDev is an open source application to support junior Full Stack Developers based in Austin through mentorship and resources. It allows those who would like to be mentees and mentors to sign up and share and sharpen their skills in different types of stack development. 


# Technologies Used


* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/)
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)


# Motivation

Our team decided to create this application thinking of those who have recently started learning coding and are overwhelmed by the amount of resources online, just like we did five months ago. Providing precise explanations for what different stack acronyms mean and how they function together, AustinJrDev offers a strong foundation for the beginners and directs them to a path they can choose. Its local platform for Austin coders makes it considerably simpler for the junior developers to connect with the amazing Austin tech community without getting overwhelmed.
